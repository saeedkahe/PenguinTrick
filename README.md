### PenguinTrick

#### Hello👋
Welcome to Penguin Trick.❤️<br>
In this program, HTML and CSS are used.<br>
<br>
We are going to practice the subject of transform a little.
<br>
### first
Well, in the first step, we create the HTML file.<br>
Now our trick has two parts.

##### head
The part of the penguin's head that includes the eyes, lips and cheeks.
##### body
The body part that includes the wings and legs and the main middle part of the body.

### second
Well, now we create our own css file.<br>
We use position to place each part of the face.<br>
We write our own desired styling, which includes colors and other things, inside the style.<br>

### third
Finally, if we like, we can write hover for this penguin.<br>
I wrote a hover animation for him that can fly!<br>
Good luck!😘<br>
